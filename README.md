# Graph Management Application

Application for Managing Graphs, and performing different types of searches in Graphs.
The Application Console Based, and it is written entirely in Python. 

# Functionalities
  1. Read a graph from a file
  2. Write a graph to a file

  6. Switch the graph
  7. Get the number of vertices
  8. Parse the vertices
  9. Get the number of edges
  10. List all edges with costs
  11. Check the existence of a vertex
  12. Find edge from x to y
  13. Get the in degree and the out degree of a specified vertex
  14. Parse the outbound edges of a vertex
  15. Parse the inbound edges of a vertex
  16. Get the cost of an edge
  17. Update the cost of an edge
  18. Add a vertex
  19. Remove a vertex
